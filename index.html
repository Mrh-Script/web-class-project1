      <h1>Md Riad Hasan</h1>
      <h3>BSCSE Student — Uttara University</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Uttara University, Bangladesh. I have complited
        my HS level from Dhaka College on 2021. I am passionate about software development, problem-solving, 
        and exploring emerging technologies. I began my coding journey with C (using SPL in my early days) 
        and am currently advancing my skills in Java while expanding into web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goals are to strengthen my problem-solving abilities, contribute to open-source projects,
        and grow into a versatile software developer. I enjoy collaborating with others, staying
        curious about new technologies, and am currently involved in an analytical research project.
